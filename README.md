The backend (server.rb) is setup for a different project, but I left the code
in there for reference. Feel free to replace with your own.

## Setup 

```
bundle
yarn install
```

## Development

The following uses foreman and Procfile.dev to run all required services
as is the new convention (in Rails at least).

```
bin/dev
```
